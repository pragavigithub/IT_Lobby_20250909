# WMS (Warehouse Management System) Application

## Overview
This is a Flask-based Warehouse Management System with SAP B1 integration. The application provides inventory management, transfer operations, barcode generation, and invoice creation functionality.

## Project Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Replit managed database)
- **Frontend**: HTML templates with Bootstrap styling
- **Integration**: SAP Business One API integration
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login for user management

## Current Configuration
- **Port**: 5000 (configured for Replit webview)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with automatic table creation
- **Environment**: Production-ready with gunicorn server
- **Logging**: File-based logging system enabled

## Key Features
- User authentication and role management
- Inventory transfer operations
- Barcode and QR code generation
- SAP B1 integration for warehouse operations
- Serial number tracking
- Invoice creation module
- Pick list management
- GRPO (Goods Receipt PO) functionality

## Credential Configuration
The application now supports reading credentials from a JSON file for better security and configuration management:

### JSON Credential File Format
Location: `/tmp/sap_login/credential.json` (Linux) or `C:/tmp/sap_login/credential.json` (Windows)

```json
{
   "SAP_B1_SERVER": "https://192.168.0.134:50000",
   "SAP_B1_USERNAME": "manager",
   "SAP_B1_PASSWORD": "1422",
   "SAP_B1_COMPANY_DB": "EINV-TESTDB-LIVE-HUST",
   "MYSQL_HOST": "localhost",
   "MYSQL_PORT": "3306",
   "MYSQL_USER": "root",
   "MYSQL_PASSWORD": "root123",
   "MYSQL_DATABASE": "it_lobby",
   "DATABASE_URL": "mysql+pymysql://root:root123@localhost:3306/it_lobby"
}
```

### Fallback Behavior
- If JSON file is not found, application falls back to environment variables
- If MySQL connection fails, application automatically falls back to PostgreSQL (Replit environment)
- All credentials support both JSON and environment variable configuration
